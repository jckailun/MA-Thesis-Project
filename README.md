Files starting with numbers (1 to 13) are the codes I had written for my thesis project. For the entire project, I coded more than 97% of what I needed: from data preparation to estimation algorithm (Newton's method with Broyden's modification); and from average marginal effects to Gap statistic. I programmed everything I needed by myself since my model was bespoke and very specific to my topic. It would have been challenging to look for what I exactly needed, since most readily available resources were for standard models. 

Files in ".xlsx" format are outputs from my codes, which include model estimation results, grid search, and marginal effects of variables. Marginal effects are the main results that my conclusions were drawn upon. 

"aaa.pdf" was my paper's final draft.
